# Difference Between Session and Cookie

## Session
Session is a way of tracking users across multiple pages as they browse a website. It's passed along the user's request as they browse pages and used in identification, authentication and authorization.

## Cookie
Cookie is very related to session as it is also used in keeping record of users but not in the web server. Cookie are rather stored in the user computer. They're used by developers to keep users preferences and records like theme, views and others for giving them better experience or restrict their actions.

## Differences between cookie and Session
> Cookies are stored in the user's browser while sessions are stored in the request, the web server.
> Sessions expires by default when the user closes their browser, cookie only expires when the time set by the developer is reached.
> Cookies path can be specified while sessions run across the entire app.
